Real Time Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition

The Real-Time Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition (RTTSDR) is a research project for an undergraduate degree thesis. The author proposed a real-time traffic sign detection and recognition system specifically in Indonesia. The basis of the dataset used is the Indonesian Traffic Sign Dataset that can be accessed through Kaggle.

The RTTSDR utilizes three models, namely YOLOv8 built by Ultralytics, initially proposed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi (2016). This system also uses the proposed RCTNet by Kim et al. (2018) to enhance the image color based on the lighting condition. The final step in this system is the classification performed using transfer learning of MobileNetV2.

The codes are written using some documentation references by Ultralytics, Tensorflow, and adaptation of RCTNet by Thanos Masouris. This repository is the official implementation of the "REAL-TIME TRAFFIC SIGN DETECTION AND RECOGNITION IN DAERAH ISTIMEWA YOGYAKARTA USING YOLOV8 AND MOBILENETV2" by Abdullah Bagir. The publication for this research paper is currently unofficial.
